# Hello, time?  
A simple, open-source clock that displays rhymes. Inspired by the Hack Club workshops [Simple Clock](https://workshops.hackclub.com/simple_clock/) and [JsonDB](https://workshops.hackclub.com/json_db/), along with the[ Poem/1](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/genmon/poem-1-the-ai-poetry-clock), an "AI rhyming clock".
Public instance: [clock.angad.me](https://clock.angad.me/)

## Background  
This is my first full-stack project and furthermore, my first JavaScript project. I'm welcome to feedback as I primarily used this project to learn and would love to know what I could have done better. However, I do think this project is usable. I can see this being used as live wallpaper or on E Ink displays such as e-readers.
